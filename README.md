View Chinese description  |  [æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡è¯´æ˜Ž](README.cn.md)

The [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) Project is a Linux router operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. Allows you to freely choose the software package you need to customize your router system. For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned. It has more than 3000+ standardized application packages and a very rich third-party plug-in support, so you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device.

Now you can replace the Android TV system of the TV box with the OpenWrt system, making it a powerful router. This project builds OpenWrt system for `Amlogic`, `Rockchip` and `Allwinner` boxes. including install to eMMC and update kernel related functions. Please refer to the [OpenWrt Documentation](./make-openwrt/documents) for the usage method.

The latest version of the OpenWrt firmware can be downloaded in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases). Welcome to use `Fork` for personalized OpenWrt firmware configuration. If you like it, Please click the `Star`.

ðŸ’¡Tip: Currently ***`s905`*** TV Boxes can only be used in `TF/SD/USB`, other types of TV Boxes also support writing to `EMMC`. Please refer to the [instructions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/build-armbian/documents/amlogic_model_database.md) for dtb and u-boot of each device.

## Install to EMMC and update instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your box. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the box. Common for all `Amlogic s9xxx TV Boxes`.

- ### Install OpenWrt

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’ `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `Amlogic Service` â†’ `Install OpenWrt`, Select your box in the Supported Devices drop-down list and click the `Install OpenWrt` button to install it.

- ### Update OpenWrt

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `Amlogic Service` â†’ `Upload updates manually / Download updates online`

If you choose `Upload Updates Manually` [OpenWrt firmware](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases), You can upload the corresponding OpenWrt firmware package, such as openwrt_s9xxx_k5.15.50_xxx.img.gz (It is recommended to upload the compressed package, and the system will automatically decompress it. If you upload the decompressed xxx.img file, the upload may fail because the file is too large), After the upload is complete, the interface will display the `Update firmware` operation button, click to update.

If you choose `Manually upload updates` [OpenWrt kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable), You can upload the three kernel files `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz` (Other kernel files are not required. If uploading at the same time does not affect the update, the system can accurately identify the required kernel files.)ï¼ŒAfter the upload is complete, the interface will display the `Update Kernel` operation button, click to update.

If you choose `Online Download Update` OpenWrt firmware or kernel, it will be downloaded according to `Firmware download address` and `Kernel download address` in `Plugin Settings`, you can customize and modify the download source, For details, please refer to the compilation and usage instructions of [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic).

Tip: Functions such as install/update are provided by [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic) to provide visual operation support. Also supports [command operations](make-openwrt/documents/README.md#8-install-the-firmware).

- ### Use OpenWrt in TF/SD/USB

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-tf
```

After activating the remaining space, the kernel and OpenWrt system can be upgraded in TF/SD/USB.

- ### Create swap for openwrt system

If you feel that the memory of the current box is not enough when you are using applications with a large memory footprint such as `docker`, you can create a `swap` virtual memory partition, Change the disk space of `/mnt/*4` A certain capacity is virtualized into memory for use. The unit of the input parameter of the following command is `GB`, and the default is `1`.

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-swap 1
```

- ### Backup/restore the original EMMC system

Supports backup/restore of the box's `EMMC` partition in `TF/SD/USB`. It is recommended that you back up the Android TV system that comes with the current box before installing the OpenWrt system in a brand new box, so that you can use it in the future when restoring the TV system.

Please start the OpenWrt system from `TF/SD/USB`, Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-ddbr
```

According to the prompt, enter `b` to perform system backup, and enter `r` to perform system recovery.

ðŸ’¡Tip: You must use the `/mnt/*4/` space to store the `BACKUP-arm-64-emmc.img.gz` backup file, Users who have not created the `TF/SD/USB` extended partition must first use the `openwrt-tf` command to create the extended partition.

- ### Controlling the LED display

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-openvfd
```

Debug according to [LED screen display control instructions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/build-armbian/documents/led_screen_display_control.md).

- ### More instructions for use

Use the `firstboot` command to restore the system to its initial state. In the use of OpenWrt, please refer to [documents](./make-openwrt/documents) for some common problems that may be encountered.

## Local build instructions

1. Install the necessary packages (E.g Ubuntu 22.04 LTS user)
```yaml
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
# For Ubuntu-22.04
sudo apt-get install -y $(curl -fsSL https://is.gd/depend_ubuntu2204_openwrt)
```
2. Clone the repository to the local. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt.git`
3. Create a `openwrt-armvirt` folder, and upload the OpenWrt firmware of the ARM kernel ( Eg: `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` ) to this `~/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/openwrt-armvirt` directory.
4. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt` root directory. And run Eg: `sudo ./make -b s905x3 -k 6.1.10`. The generated OpenWrt firmware is in the `out` directory under the root directory.

## Use GitHub Actions to build

You can modify the configuration file in the [config-openwrt](config-openwrt) directory and `.yml` file, customize the OpenWrt firmware, and complete the packaging online through `Actions`, and complete all the compilation of OpenWrt firmware in github.com One-stop.

1. Personalized plug-in configuration in [documents](./make-openwrt/documents) directory. Workflows configuration in [.yml](.github/workflows) file.
2. New compilation: Select ***`Build OpenWrt`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.
3. Compile again: If there is an `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` file in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases), you do not need to compile it completely, you can directly use this file to `build openwrt` of different board. Select ***`Use Releases file to Packaging`*** on the [Actions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/openwrt) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.
4. More support: The compiled `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` file is a common file for making various board firmware, and it is also suitable for making OpenWrt firmware using [unifreq's packaging script](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit). As the pioneer of using OpenWrt and Armbian system in the box, he has supported more devices, such as OpenWrt ([qemu version](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit/blob/master/files/qemu-aarch64/qemu-aarch64-readme.md)) as used by `KVM` virtual machine on [Armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) system, Amlogic, and Rockchip, and Allwinner series, etc. For details on the packaging method, please refer to his source code repository description. In Actions, you can use [packaging-openwrt-for-qemu-etc.yml](.github/workflows/packaging-openwrt-for-qemu-etc.yml) to call his packaging script to make more firmware.

## Compile the kernel

For the compilation method of the kernel, see [compile-kernel](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/compile-kernel)

```yaml
- name: Compile the kernel
  uses: ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian@main
  with:
    build_target: kernel
    kernel_version: 6.1.10_5.15.50
    kernel_auto: true
    kernel_sign: -yourname
```

## Resource Description

When making an OpenWrt system, the [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and [u-boot](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/tree/main/build-armbian/u-boot) files used are the same files used to make an [Armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) system. In order to avoid repeated maintenance, the relevant content is classified and placed in the corresponding resource repository, and it will be automatically downloaded from the relevant repository when it is used.

The `kernel` / `u-boot` and other resources used by this system are mainly copied from the project of [unifreq/openwrt_packit](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit), Some files are shared by users in [Pull](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/issues) of [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt) / [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) / [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic) / [kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel) and other projects. `unifreq` opened the door for us to use OpenWrt in TV Boxes, and was deeply influenced by him. My firmware has inherited his consistent standards in production and use. To thank these pioneers and sharers, I have recorded them in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Thanks again everyone for giving new life and meaning to the Boxes.

## Other distributions

- [unifreq](https://github.com/unifreq/openwrt_packit) has made `OpenWrt` system for more boxes such as `Amlogic`, `Rockchip` and `Allwinner`, which is a benchmark in the box circle and is recommended for use.
- The [amlogic-s9xxx-armbian](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian) project provides the `Armbian` system used in the box, which is also applicable to the relevant devices that support OpenWrt.
